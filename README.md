# Hobbies and Interests 
My name is Zukhra. This is my portfolio project. The page was built with HTML, styled with CSS and use a bit of JavaScript. During the work on this project, I learned:

1. Deepened my knowledge about HTML/CSS.
2. Learned how to alternate the display of one of two images by clicking the displayed image. I used JavaScript and DOM API features for this.
3. Learned how to use JavaScript to generate the current date, and DOM manipulation to display it.


## Step-by-step process:
1. Sketching a web page on the paper. I think that every projects should start with plan. 
2. Selecting the desired images by using Lorem Picsum. 
3. Building a template of the page for clarity and simplicity using Bootstrap CSS.
4. Add script to alternate the display of one of two images by clicking the displayed image. Function was implomented for images number 1 and number 2.
5. Generate one original image (number 3) by using AI Image generator. I always wanted to use this tool.
6. Implimenting the feature that will allow to alternate the display of one of two images by clicking the displayed image.
7. Removing BootstrapCSS settings and customizing the HTML ans CSS files to meet the requirements. One of the main goal of this project is to learn how to build the web page without using the special labraries.
8. Adding the current date on the page.
